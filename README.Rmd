<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of aqua is to provide tools that help with different assay qualification and validation project analysis and reporting.

## Installation

You can install aqua. I hope. You're on your own.

``` r
install.packages("aqua")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(aqua)

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
